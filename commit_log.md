commit 0
    This is a habit I have personally. I name all my commits like "com0", "com1" and such. Here, I list what each commit is about. 
    I setup the node environment, installed the express package and configured a simple server to send the index.ejs file for any get requests at root dir.
    I served the css and script files using express.static(). 
    I'm going to use them to style and update the page without reloading. This is the approach I've taken because ajax is something I've never used and regular post requests will refresh the page.
commit 1
    added an environment variable for Render to use
commit 2
    I "finished it". However, I neglected a lot in terms of style and naming things. The classes are terrible, the css is messed, the IDs are messed, I just writed it to work, not to be good. 
    For further use, I would rewrite everything with BEM in css, more thoughtful IDs, better HTML hierarchy and cleaner Javascript.
commit 3
    I capped the quantity value to 5 and added another event trigger.
commit 4
    I didn't notice how I was erasing the "obj3" element to update the divs and fixed it.
commit 5
    limited characters the user can type to 1.
